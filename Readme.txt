README for the clsTablePrint example
------------------------------------

clsTablePrint is a class module allowing you to print grids on the printer, a PictureBox or Form quite easy without using any external OCX.
In mdlTPHelper.bas a function to import a MSFlexGrid is included. The class will also run without this module !
In the DBGrid subdirectory you can find an easy to use import module for DBGrids and a sample about the use.
FxlGrdDemo.vbp is a Demo application showing how to use this class with an MSFlexGrid.
In the subdirectory "Standalone Demo" you can find a demo how to use the class without an MSFlexGrid.
In the subdirectory "DBGrid" you find a demo how to print a DBGrid.
In the subdirectory "ListView" you find a demo how to print a ListView in report view with this class (not perfect, but I think it should work for most people).


If you find a bug in the class, have suggestions (or questions) concerning the class, please write an eMail to the author (jwolzvb@yahoo.de).
